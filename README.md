# pdfkivygui
Pandas Dataframe Kivy Gui (pdfkivygui) is a custom widget that allows you to use Pandas Dataframe with matplotlib in a 
custom kivy widget. I started with a fork of [PandasDataframeGuiKivy](https://github.com/MichaelStott/PandasDataframeGUIKivy) 
created by Michael Stott, which was based on [PandasDataFrameGui](https://github.com/bluenote10/PandasDataFrameGUI) which 
was created by bluenote10. After 24 hours of working and modifying my original fork, I decided to recreate the entire 
library. Thus pdfkivygui was born.

## Features
* Enables properties so you can customize the graph without having to touch source code.
* Will be packaged up and put up on PyPI for easy install into any project.

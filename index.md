# Welcome to Pandas Dataframe Kivy Gui Library

Pandas Dataframe Kivy Gui (pdfkivygui) is a Python package that allows you to use Pandas Dataframe with matplotlib 
in a custom kivy widget. I started with a fork of PandasDataframeGuiKivy created by Michael Stott, which was based on 
PandasDataFrameGui which was created by bluenote10. After 24 hours of working and modifying my original fork, I decided \
to recreate the entire library. Thus pdfkivygui was born.
